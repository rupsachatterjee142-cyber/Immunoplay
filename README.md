# 🧬 ImmunoPlay: Urban Lifestyle & Immune Health Predictor

ImmunoPlay is a bioengineering project developed to simulate how daily urban habits—like sleep, stress, and diet—impact human immune resilience.

## 🧪 The Science Behind the Code
This project uses a weighted biological logic engine to predict health risks:
- **Cortisol Impact:** High stress levels (1-10) simulate increased cortisol, which suppresses T-cell activity.
- **Sleep & Cytokines:** Calculations factor in how sleep deprivation (<7h) reduces natural killer (NK) cell effectiveness.
- **Inflammatory Load:** Junk food intake is weighted to simulate systemic inflammation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:** Pandas (Data handling), Scikit-learn (ML), Pygame (Simulation)
- **Architecture:** Modular (Separated Source, Data, and Tests)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/rupsachatterjee142-cyber/Immunoplay.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas scikit-learn pygame`
3. Run the predictor: `python src/predictor.py`
